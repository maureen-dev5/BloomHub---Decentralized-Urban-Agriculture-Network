## Overview

BloomHub is a revolutionary decentralized platform built on Stacks blockchain that connects urban growers, tracks agricultural yields, and rewards sustainable cultivation practices. By leveraging blockchain technology, BloomHub creates a transparent, incentivized ecosystem where community members can share growing spaces, document harvests, and build reputation through verifiable on-chain records.

## Vision

Urban agriculture faces challenges of fragmented knowledge, lack of recognition for sustainable practices, and difficulty in building trust within growing communities. BloomHub addresses these pain points by:

- **Democratizing Knowledge**: Creating an immutable database of cultivation plots and yield data
- **Rewarding Contribution**: Tokenizing community participation through BGT rewards
- **Building Trust**: Establishing transparent reputation systems through blockchain verification
- **Fostering Community**: Connecting growers through decentralized plot sharing and assessment

## Core Features

### üå± Plot Registration System
- **Decentralized Database**: Register urban growing spaces with comprehensive metadata
- **Detailed Specifications**: Track plot size, soil type, light exposure, and location data
- **Classification System**: Categorize plots as community, rooftop, urban, or suburban
- **Registration Rewards**: Earn 2.4 BGT for contributing new plots to the network

### üìä Yield Tracking & Documentation
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Record cultivar types, harvest weights, growing methods, and seasonal data
- **Success Metrics**: Track harvest outcomes with binary success indicators
- **Method Tracking**: Document organic, traditional, or hydroponic cultivation styles
- **Incentive Structure**: 
  - Successful harvests: 1.9 BGT
  - Learning experiences (unsuccessful): 0.633 BGT

### üë®‚Äçüåæ Grower Profiles
- **Identity Management**: Customizable display names and specialty designations
- **Performance Metrics**: Automatic tracking of yields, plots contributed, and cultivars grown
- **Tier Progression**: Dynamic ranking system (1-5) based on cumulative harvest mass
- **Portfolio Building**: Comprehensive on-chain history of all agricultural activities

### ‚≠ê Community Assessment System
- **Plot Reviews**: Rate growing spaces on a 1-10 scale with detailed commentary
- **Output Evaluation**: Classify plots by productivity (high, medium, low)
- **Endorsement Mechanism**: Community validation of helpful assessments
- **Reputation Building**: Aggregated ratings provide trust signals for plot quality

### üèÜ Achievement Framework
- **Milestone Recognition**: Unlock badges based on activity thresholds
- **Substantial Rewards**: 8.8 BGT per achievement unlocked
- **Built-in Achievements**:
  - `grower-50`: Complete 50 successful yields
  - `community-9`: Register 9 cultivation plots
- **Extensible Design**: Framework supports future badge additions

## Tokenomics

### BloomHub Growth Token (BGT)

**Token Specifications**
- **Symbol**: BGT
- **Precision**: 6 decimals
- **Maximum Supply**: 41,000 BGT
- **Distribution Model**: Activity-based minting

**Incentive Breakdown**

| Activity | Reward | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Successful Yield | 1.9 BGT | Encourage consistent documentation |
| Unsuccessful Yield | 0.633 BGT | Reward honesty and learning |
| Plot Registration | 2.4 BGT | Expand network database |
| Achievement Unlock | 8.8 BGT | Recognize long-term commitment |

**Economic Principles**
1. **Merit-Based Distribution**: Rewards align with value creation
2. **Failure Tolerance**: Partial rewards encourage honest reporting
3. **Long-Term Incentives**: Achievement bonuses reward sustained participation
4. **Supply Constraints**: Fixed cap ensures token scarcity and value

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Structure

**State Management**
- Token ledger with supply tracking
- Sequential ID generation for plots and yields
- Five core data maps for comprehensive state storage
- Efficient helper functions for profile management

**Data Models**

#### Grower Registry
```clarity
{
  display-name: (string-ascii 24),
  specialty: (string-ascii 12),
  yield-entries: uint,
  plot-contributions: uint,
  cultivars-tracked: uint,
  grower-tier: uint,
  enrollment-block: uint
}
```

#### Plot Database
```clarity
{
  plot-title: (string-ascii 36),
  geo-location: (string-ascii 26),
  plot-classification: (string-ascii 12),
  area-sqm: uint,
  substrate: (string-ascii 10),
  light-exposure: (string-ascii 8),
  coordinator: principal,
  yield-records: uint,
  community-rating: uint
}
```

#### Yield Registry
```clarity
{
  plot-reference: uint,
  grower: principal,
  cultivar: (string-ascii 20),
  mass-grams: uint,
  cultivation-style: (string-ascii 12),
  growing-season: (string-ascii 8),
  yield-commentary: (string-ascii 110),
  recorded-block: uint,
  harvest-success: bool
}
```

### Security Features

‚úÖ **Input Validation**: Comprehensive checks on all user inputs  
‚úÖ **Access Control**: Permission checks for sensitive operations  
‚úÖ **Duplicate Prevention**: Guards against review and achievement spam  
‚úÖ **Supply Cap Enforcement**: Prevents token inflation  
‚úÖ **Immutable Records**: Core data cannot be altered post-creation  
‚úÖ **Event Logging**: Transparent audit trail for all activities  

## Usage Examples

### Register a Growing Plot

```clarity
(contract-call? .bloomhub register-plot
  "Urban Rooftop Garden - Block 5"
  "40.7580¬∞ N, 73.9855¬∞ W"
  "rooftop"
  u25                    ;; 25 square meters
  "loamy"
  "full"
)
```

### Record Harvest Yield

```clarity
(contract-call? .bloomhub record-yield
  u1                     ;; plot-reference
  "Cherry Tomatoes"
  u3500                  ;; 3.5 kg in grams
  "organic"
  "summer"
